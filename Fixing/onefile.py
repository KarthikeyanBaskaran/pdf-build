    Resume Generation Guidelines:

    1.  **Work Experience:**
        * For each role, select the **top 3 most relevant achievements** from my resume.
        * Rewrite them using **strong action verbs** and **quantifiable results** (e.g., "Increased sales by 15%", "Reduced costs by $10K", "Managed a team of 5").
        * Ensure these points clearly demonstrate transferable skills.

    2.  **Projects :**
        * You can generate new projects with difficulty level easy when some mandatory keywords or technology is missing in my work experience. 
        * Each project title should be **short and precise (max 3 words)**.
        * Provide a **single-line description** for each project.
        * Include relevant keywords for each project.

    3.  Professional Summary:**
        *Write a powerful 1-line professional summary that that highlights my most relevant skills and experience for this job.  based on resume and job description and hooks a recruiter in under 10 seconds. 

    4.  **Skills:**
        * List up to **6 key skill categories**.
        * Under each category, provide up to **3 highly relevant keywords** (avoiding repetition). These keywords should directly reflect terms from the job description and my resume.
